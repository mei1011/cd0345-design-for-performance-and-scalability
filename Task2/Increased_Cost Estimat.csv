"We decided to make some changes to our AWS resources to optimize our performance and cost. For our web server, we switched from an m5.2xlarge to an m4.xlarge EC2 instance,  because we found that we didn't need the extra memory and network bandwidth of the m5 family. For our app server, we upgraded from an m5.2xlarge to an m5.4xlarge EC2 instance, because we needed more compute power and scalability for our growing application. We also increased our CloudFront data transfer out to the internet by 10 TB per month, to improve the speed and availability of our content delivery to our global customers. Additionally, we increased our S3 Standard storage from 10 TB to 50 TB per month, to store more data and backups in a durable and cost-effective way. Finally, we increased our RDS for MySQL backup storage by 10 TB, to ensure that we have enough space to restore our database in case of any failure or disaster.",,,,,,,,,
